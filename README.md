### Running the Project 🏃‍♂️🏃‍♀️

**NOTE:** To run the JAR file, Java Version jdk1.8.0 should be used. Follow these steps to check and set up Java 8:

1. Check whether you have Java 8 installed. Run this command in the terminal:
       java -version

2. If Java 8 is not available, please download and install it from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html).

3. Once it is installed, run the following code in the terminal, replacing XXX with the update number of your Java 8 installation:
       export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_XXX.jdk/Contents/Home

4. Check that it has switched to Java 8 by running the `java -version` command again.

5. Once Java version 8 is used, run the JAR file using the following command in the terminal:
       java -jar TopQuiz-master.jar

6. If the JAR is not running, please run the Main class in the source code.
